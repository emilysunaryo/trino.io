Client drivers communicate between applications and systems like Trino,
enabling applications to submit SQL queries and retrieve results across a
wide range of data sources configured in Trino's catalogs.

These drivers are
libraries that makes it possible for other systems supporting the driver to
use and have acccess to Trino's powerful querying engine. They help in
creating data pipelines that manage data from Trino to external data sources
such as custom data applications.

Drivers can be integrated into custom scripts or other business applications.
